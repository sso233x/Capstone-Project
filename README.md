### To Start Project

**You will need two terminal windows open, 
one for the frontend and one for the backend.**

**The backend will use localhost:5000 and the frontend will use localhost:3000**

1. ### Navigate to the Back-End first
   cd backend
   
   ### To Start
   flask run/python app.py (could be python3 app.py)

2. ### Navigate to the Front-End
   cd frontend

   ### To Start
   npm start


### The app will then start in your browser.
